               At service office, like the DMV, there is a need to sign in to a waiting list. 
               For this Lab, you need to create a waiting list program. 
               The program should have an interactive menu that allows you to add an individual to the list,  
               check who is next on the list and remove the next person once they are helped. 

				For implementation a Queue container should be used. The interactive menu should have at least 4 options:

				Add a person.
				check who is next.
				Assist next person (and remove from list)
				exit.

		while(choice != 4)

				case 1: 
						if(q1.isFull()) 
							System.out.println("The line is currently full.\n");

							String x = sc.nextLine();
							q1.enqueue(x);
							System.out.println(x + " has been added to the list.\n");
