# Computer-Class-Code

This repository holds all of my old code, I keep it if I ever want to use a template for a linked list or something similar. Most of these are in java, but there are others. Some are saved as .txt files, that is because in my first coding class, I was coding in an IDE emulator rather than an actual IDE because the emulator was ablle to grade my work for the professor.

Not all of this code is optimized, as I was still learning when I made it, but it all works without error.
